# Data Structures and Algorithms Using C#
Reading Note

## Preface
As you may know, this book contains a lot of mistakes. I will stop reading it at any time if I cannot stand the mistakes. 

## How to Use
Each chapter is separated in different folder/project. You can go to individual folder to check README.md which is the reading note.
