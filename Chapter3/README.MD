# Chapter 3: Basic Sorting Algorithms

## SORTING ALGORITHMS
* Insertion sort
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort

### An Array Class Test Bed
see sample code for this implementation of test bed.

### Bubble Sort
values "float like a bubble" from one end of the list to another. This behavior is caused by moving through the list many times, comparing adjacent values and swapping them **if the value to the left is greater than the value to the right**.

### Selection Sort
This sort works by starting at the beginning of the array, comparing the first element with the other elements in the array. The smallest element is palced in position 0, and the sort then begins again at position 1. This continues until each position except the last position has been the starting point for a new loop.

### Insertion Sort
Like organizing cards.
